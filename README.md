# RegularizationSurveyECE247
Group Project for novel regularization methods across CNN, GANs and LSTMs

Regularization is a key factor for generalization of state- of-the-art models. While traditional regularization methods have often been used for these models, novel regularization techniques have been proposed in recent years to tackle generalization problems faced by specific model architec- tures. While there are differences in architectures between models, certain aspects like loss functions, optimizers (Gradient Descent and Variations), weight matrices and dropout techniques are uniform across them. This lends itself to the possibility of certain novel regularizers working across ar- chitecture types. In this survey paper, we try out a few different novel regularization techniques proposed on archi- tectures beyond the one considered in the original paper. We then observe if it is behaving as expected, summarize the performance, and present our conclusions.
